--- OpenFOAM race car adapter ---

This program creates steady state OpenFOAM simulations for several wind
attack angles.

Warning: This all expects a linux system with OpenFOAM and Python 3 installed.

Components:

 1. Ahmed example body generator.
  
  BRLCAD [brlcad] is used to generate an ahmed body using
  data from paper [Bordei, Poescu].

  Invoke using:

   make ahmed

 2. Simulation files

  Based on the motorBike example from OpenFOAM. Some key parts are
  overwritten by the generator module.

  Do not invoke directly since it depends on generated files.

 3. Simulation generator

  Generates OpenFOAM files for several vehicle directions, wind directions
  and wind speeds. Invokes the Simulation files automatically.

  Example: Invoke as part of a job as:

   generator$ python3 calculate.py --windAngle 0.1 --windSpeed 10 20\
                --vehicleSpeed 0

  This will calculate for all combinations of wind angle, wind speed and
  vehicle speed.

 4. Coefficient library

  The public interface in "interpolation.py" permits easy access to Delaunay
  interpolated data.
